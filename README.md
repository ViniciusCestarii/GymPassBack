# Gym Pass üèãÔ∏è

## ‚ùì What's Gym Pass

 Gym Pass is an application that enables users to conveniently check in to registered gyms using their mobile phones. The check-in process is validated by the respective gym to ensure accuracy and security. Furthermore, users have the option to search for nearby gyms, view the number of check-ins to stay motivated. Gyms interested in joining the platform simply need to sign up.

This project is the Server Side of Gym Pass containing:

- API for all the entities of the application
- End to end and unitary tests
- Auth using JWT token
- SOLID principles
- Business rules
